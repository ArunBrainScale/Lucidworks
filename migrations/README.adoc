= Fusion 5 Migration Guide

The migration process varies depending on your current version of Fusion.

== Migrating from Fusion 5.0.x to 5.1.x

If you're currently running Fusion 5.0.x, then you need to perform three steps before upgrading to 5.1.0. If you are installing Fusion 5.1.0 into a new namespace, then you can safely skip these steps.

. Prepare Upgrade Solr 8.4.1
. Install Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRDs) for Seldon Core
. Delete the Logstash StatefulSet (only needed for clusters running 5.0.3-2 or earlier)

=== Prepare for Upgrade to Solr 8.4.1

Lucene 8.4.1 introduced an incompatible change to the underlying `postingsFormat` for the `tagger` field type in the schema for query_rewrite collections.
For additional background on the Solr text tagger and the `FST50` postings format, see: https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/8_3/the-tagger-handler.html

Consequently, before you upgrade to Solr 8.4.1, you need to re-index the query_rewrite documents to remove the use of the `postingsFormat`.
Otherwise, when Solr 8.4.1 initializes, it will not be able to load the query_rewrite collections.
After upgrading, you'll re-index once again to restore the `postingsFormat` using the new implementation; the custom `postingsFormat` is essential for achieving optimal text tagging performance.

==== Prerequisites

Before proceeding, please https://github.com/lucidworks/fusion-cloud-native[follow the upgrade instructions
 corresponding to your cloud platform here] to upgrade your Fusion 5 installation to the latest Helm chart: `5.0.3-4`.

Make sure you're running on Zookeeper 3.5.6 and Solr 8.3.1 and that all collections are healthy.

You *should not* be actively making changes to the `query_rewrite` collections (via Rules UI) during the upgrade process.

For production systems, this upgrade process should be performed during a maintenance window.

===== Backup the query_rewrite and query_rewrite_staging collections

Lucidworks recommends taking a backup of your query rewrite collections just in case something goes wrong with the upgrade, especially for production environments.

Depending on your Ingress config, the export may take too long and timeout. Consequently, we recommend opening a kubectl port-forward to the Fusion Gateway pod:
```
kubectl port-forward <POD> 6764
```

Then export the collection(s) to a local JSON file using the `/query/query-rewrite/export/<COLL>` endpoint. For instance:
```
PROXY="http://localhost:6764"
APP="YOUR_FUSION_APP_ID"
curl -u $CREDS "$PROXY/query/query-rewrite/export/${APP}_query_rewrite_staging" > ${APP}_query_rewrite_staging.json
curl -u $CREDS "$PROXY/query/query-rewrite/export/${APP}_query_rewrite" > ${APP}_query_rewrite.json
```
__Replace `$CREDS` with your Fusion admin username and password__, for example `-u admin:somepassword`

Repeat this command for *every Fusion application* that has data indexed in the `query_rewrite_staging` and `query_rewrite` collections.

==== Upgrade Steps

In order to upgrade from Solr 8.3.1 to 8.4.1, you need to re-index all query_rewrite and query_rewrite_staging collections that have indexed data.

Lucidworks provides a utility Docker image to drive the re-index process.

If your installation does not have indexed documents in any of the `query_rewrite` collections, then you can safely upgrade to Solr 8.4.1 using a Helm upgrade.

1) Run the *prepare* step

The *prepare* step re-indexes the query_rewrite collections into a temp collection after removing the `postingsFormat` from the `tagger` field type in the Solr schema.
This ensures the temp collections can be restored when Solr 8.4.1 initializes.

```
kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 \
  --image="lucidworks/fm-upgrade-query-rewrite:1.x" \
  --restart=Never \
  --env="HELM_RELEASE=<CHANGEME>" \
  --env="ACTION=prepare" prepare-upgrade-solr841
```
*Be sure to change the HELM_RELEASE value to the release name (NOT the version) of your Fusion 5 installation.* You can find this using `helm list`
against your Fusion 5 namespace (find the release that's using the "fusion" chart and look at the name column). Typically, the
release name is the same as your namespace name.

Wait until the `prepare-upgrade-solr841` pod shows status `Completed`

2) Upgrade to Solr 8.4.1 using the standard Fusion 5 Helm upgrade process (set the Solr tag version to `8.4.1` in custom values yaml)

3) Verify all `*_temp_fix` collections are online and healthy

4) Run the *restore* step

The *restore* step re-indexes the temp collections back into the original query_rewrite collections after restoring the `postingsFormat` on the tagger field with the new implementation added in Lucene 8.4.1.

```
kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 \
  --image="lucidworks/fm-upgrade-query-rewrite:1.x" \
  --restart=Never \
  --env="HELM_RELEASE=<CHANGEME>" \
  --env="ACTION=restore" restore-upgrade-solr841
```
*Be sure to change the HELM_RELEASE value to the release name of your Fusion 5 installation.*

Wait until the `restore-upgrade-solr841` pod shows status `Completed`

5) Verify all query rewrite collections are online and healthy

6) Delete the prepare and restore pods

```
kubectl delete po prepare-upgrade-solr841
kubectl delete po restore-upgrade-solr841
```

=== Install Seldon Core CRD

Fusion 5.1.0 introduces https://www.seldon.io/tech/products/core/[Seldon Core] for ML model serving. Seldon Core installs Kuberentes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD). Due to a limitation in how Helm handles CRDs during upgrades to an existing cluster, you need to install the CRDs into a temp namespace before attempting an upgrade to your existing namespace.

Run the following commands to create a temporary namespace and install the Seldon Core CRDs into the K8s cluster:
```
kubectl create namespace tmp-crd-install
helm install --namespace tmp-crd-install tmp-crd lucidworks/fusion --version 5.1.0 --debug \
  --set "solr.enabled=false" --set "fusion-admin.enabled=false" \
  --set "fusion-indexing.enabled=false" --set "query-pipeline.enabled=false" \
  --set "api-gateway.enabled=false" --set "classic-rest-service.enabled=false" \
  --set "sql-service.enabled=false" --set "zookeeper.enabled=false" \
  --set "job-launcher.enabled=false" --set "job-rest-service.enabled=false" \
  --set "rest-service.enabled=false" --set "rpc-service.enabled=false" \
  --set "logstash.enabled=false" --set "webapps.enabled=false"
helm delete --namespace tmp-crd-install tmp-crd
kubectl delete namespace tmp-crd-install
```

You may now proceed to upgrade to Fusion 5.1.0. Be sure to update the `CHART_VERSION` to `5.1.0` in your upgrade script.

=== Delete Logstash StatefulSet

If you're running Fusion 5.0.3-2 or earlier, then you need to delete the Logstash StatefulSet. The data will remain intact and Logstash will be restored correctly during the Fusion upgrade.
```
kubectl delete sts <RELEASE>-logstash
```
